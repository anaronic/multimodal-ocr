# GP-AI OCR Prototype (Images Only)

This project is a simple, user-friendly OCR application built using Streamlit and the Doctr library. It enables users to upload images and quickly extract textual content with a sleek, modern interface.

---

## Features

- Upload images in PNG, JPG, and JPEG formats.
- Perform OCR using a pretrained Doctr model.
- Display extracted text in a styled, readable box.
- Show the uploaded image alongside the extracted text.
- Clean UI enhanced with custom CSS for better user experience.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit** for rapid web app development.
- **Doctr** for robust OCR processing.
- **Pillow (PIL)** for image handling.
- Python standard libraries for file management.

---

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
2. Install dependencies using:

pip install streamlit doctr pillow

text

3. Save the app script (e.g., `app.py`) and run:

streamlit run app.py

text

## Usage

- Upload an image through the file uploader.
- View extracted text and the original image side by side.
- Designed for simple, single-image text extraction.

## Future Scale-Up Ideas

- **Batch Processing:** Enable uploading multiple files for bulk OCR.
- **Format Support:** Extend to PDFs, scanned documents, and handwritten text recognition.
- **Language Support:** Integrate multi-language OCR capabilities.
- **Editing & Exporting:** Allow users to edit extracted text and export to formats like TXT, DOCX, or PDF.
- **Cloud Integration:** Host on scalable cloud platforms to support a growing user base.
- **API Development:** Create REST APIs to provide OCR as a service for other applications.

## Business Potential

Optical Character Recognition is a rapidly growing market driven by digital transformation. This prototype can be developed into:

- **Document Digitization Services:** For businesses converting paper to digital documents.
- **Data Entry Automation:** Minimizing manual input for industries like finance, healthcare, and logistics.
- **Mobile Apps:** Enabling on-the-go text extraction for consumers and professionals.
- **Integration with Enterprise Workflows:** Automating invoice processing, contract analysis, and records management.
- **Accessibility Tools:** Helping visually impaired users by converting text in images to speech.

With continued development and scaling, this product can enter multiple verticals, addressing manual data processing pain points and unlocking significant efficiency gains.
